# MLX90614 Temperature Sesnor
I started working with MLX temperature sensors in Arduino which helped me understand the fundamentals of data collection, conversion, and displayâ€”skills that are vital for health-related applications. MLX temperature sensors became especially significant during COVID-19, where they were widely used for contactless temperature screening to prevent virus spread. Inspired by their practical application, I expanded this concept into my "Diabetic Foot Analyzer" project.
